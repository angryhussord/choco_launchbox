    <summary>LaunchBox was originally built as an attractive frontend to DOSBox, but has since expanded to support both modern PC games and emulated console platforms.</summary>
    <description>LaunchBox includes automated import processes for Steam, D-Fend Reloaded, and ROM files in order to help get you up and running as quickly as possible. Game box-art and metadata is automatically downloaded from TheGamesDB.net, a community-based online database that allows anyone to contribute. More import processes are planned for the near future.</description>
